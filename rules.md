# Rules in Brief

- These rules are for 2 player, see website for multiplayer versions. See reverse side for special rolls.

##Object of Game:
Each player tries add and/or multiply the values on the 5 Platonic dice (d4, d6, d8, d12, d20) to come as close as they can, or equal the value set on the Target Dice (10-90). The Indicator Dice (0-9) indicates how close they came to the Target Dice. See reverse side for special rolls and instant win and instant losses combinations.

## How to Play:
Each player gets five tokens (or fewer for a shorter game). Players throws the d20 dice to determine who goes first, highest wins. They each put in one token. Player #1 tosses the Target Dice to set the Target Value (00 is instant loss). Player #1 then selects any one the 5 dice and places it in the Multiplication Row. If the value on that dice is within 9 points of the Target Value they can decide to stop and set the Indicator Dice to how far they are away from the Target Value. Otherwise  Player #1 throws a second dice and they can multiply the two dice by placing it in the Multiplication Row, or they may add the values by placing the second dice below on the Addition Column. Once they start in the Addition Column, no more dice can be placed in the Multiplication Row. If they use up all 5 dice, then Player #1 calls out their total score, and picks up all the dice and starts again tossing any one dice and placing it in the Multiplication Row, and play continues until they exceed the Target Value (loss) or decide to stop and set the value on the Indicator Dice.

Assuming Player #1 didn’t go over the Target Value, it is now Player #2 turn to try to tie or exceed Player#1 total. Player #2 rolls one dice and continues in the same manner as Player #1. If Player #1 equals the score of Player #1 they can stop, or try to exceed their score. If both players make the Target Value, it is a tie and another token is put in, and Player #1 starts again.

These “rounds” continue until one player has lost all their tokens. If game is taking too long, players may agree to double their wager.
